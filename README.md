Description:

Blut & Wasser is a first person shooter set in a post apocalyptic Hamburg in the near future.
The player is tasked with fighting a gang of water horders by traveling up a hotel, floor by floor, finding keycards to unlock the next floor.
Inspired by extraction shooters and roguelikes, inbetween runs the player can buy new things from the shop.

The game is currently in ALPHA, as such it lacks features, content and has many bugs. This version is for testing purposes.
This branch does not contain code as it is not an open source game.

Instructions:

Before each run you spawn at your home base where you can buy upgrades, to start a run exit the building using the main entrance.
You are rewarded with money for kills and water, but loose everything on death. You'll need to find a keycard to get to the next floor but can return home using the right elevator at any point.
Guns can't be reloaded and you'll need to scavenge for new ones.
